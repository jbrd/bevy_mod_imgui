## Current Status

This repository is actively maintained and updated when new versions of Bevy are released. New feature
requests are also welcome, although this project remains relatively low priority, so it may take some
time for these to be honoured. Contributions welcome - please do start an issue prior to working on
a feature so that it can be discussed before spending time on it.

This crate is not related to any official Bevy organisation repository in any way.
